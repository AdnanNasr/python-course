"""
- String creation: Strings can be created using single quotes (' '), double quotes (" "), or triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """).
- String concatenation: Combine multiple strings using the `+` operator.
- String repetition: Repeat a string multiple times using the `*` operator.
- String indexing: Access individual characters in a string using zero-based indexing.
- String slicing: Extract a substring using the slice notation [start:end:step].
- String methods: Use built-in methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`, etc., to manipulate strings.
- String immutability: Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation.
- Escape sequences: Use backslashes (`\`) to include special characters like newlines (`\n`) or tabs (`\t`) in strings.
- String formatting: Format strings using f-strings, `.format()`, or the `%` operator for dynamic content.

This module provides examples and explanations for each of these concepts to help you understand and work with strings effectively in Python.
